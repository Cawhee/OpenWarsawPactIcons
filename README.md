Let's make Warsaw Pact inspired icons!
#About
The Warsaw Pact was a binding agreement between several communist countries of the 20th century. These flags tend to focus greatly on use of bright color and nationalistic elements. Though the majority of these nations have fallen in the advent of the fall The Soviet Union, their place in history is important. 

Therefore, in my love of history and of creating svg flags, **OpenWarsawPactIcons** was born.

#Categories
I'm unsure of categories should be created, but at the moment I have started with flags. Perhaps we should move on to maps & emblems as each state caries a nice looking emblem.
